# Hadia Abdullah  

**Full-Stack Engineer | Blockchain Builder | Applied AI Explorer**

I build real systems end-to-end — from smart contracts to APIs to user-facing interfaces.

I’m currently working at the intersection of decentralized systems, backend engineering, and applied AI, focusing on production-ready architecture rather than hype cycles.

## 🚀 Selected Work Themes

### 🔗 Blockchain & dApps
- Built and deployed ERC-20 tokens using Hardhat  
- Integrated React frontend with deployed smart contracts (Metamask connection, on-chain calls)  
- Developed a DeFi price alert prototype using Chainlink price feeds  
- Focus on clean contract architecture and frontend-contract integration  

### 🧱 Full-Stack Systems
- Authentication flows and structured React components  
- Backend APIs and automation scripts in Python  
- Organized production-style file structures  
- Logging, state handling, and integration logic  

### 🤖 Machine Learning Projects
- Telecom churn prediction  
- House price prediction using log transformations to improve regression accuracy and reduce skew  
- Applied TF-IDF vectorization for text modeling  
- Evaluated models using precision, recall, F1-score, MAE, MSE, RMSE

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

I’m not interested in boxing myself into Web2, Web3, or AI labels.

I care about:
- Strong foundations  
- Clean architecture  
- Real integration between systems  
- Building things that can scale beyond demo-level  

Long term: Build technically strong products that merge decentralized systems with intelligent automation.

## 🌱 What This GitHub Represents

This is not a collection of random coursework.  
It’s a lab for building real systems.

You’ll find:
- Production-style dApps  
- ML experiments with proper evaluation  
- Backend utilities and automation  
- Structured learning repositories with implementation depth
